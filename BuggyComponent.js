This React Native code uses a deprecated method of setting state. The `setState` method with a callback function is outdated and can lead to unexpected behavior and race conditions.  Instead, the functional component should use the `useState` hook's setter function directly, or the class component should use the functional update approach via the `setState` method with a function that takes the current state as an argument. This avoids potential bugs that arise from accessing stale state within the callback.
